'''Open science''' is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its [[dissemination]] [[free access|accessible]] to all levels of society, amateur or professional.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Woelfle|first1=M.|last2=Olliaro|first2=P.|last3=Todd|first3=M.

Usage of the term varies substantially across disciplines, with a notable prevalence in the [[STEM]] disciplines. '''Open research''' is often used quasi-synonymously to address the gap that the denotion of "science" might have regarding an inclusion of the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. The primary focus connecting all disciplines is the widespread uptake of new technologies and tools, and the underlying ecology of the production, dissemination and reception of knowledge from a research-based point-of-view.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=FOSTER Consortium |title=What is Open Science? |website=Zenodo |access-date=13 August 2020 |url=https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/2326 |doi=10.5281/zenodo.2629946 |date=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tennant |first1=J |last2=Beamer |first2=J E |last3=Bosman |first3=J |last4=Brembs |first4=B |last5=Chung |first5=N C |last6=Clement |first6=G |last7=Crick |first7=T |last8=Dugan |first8=J |last9=Dunning |first9=A |last10=Eccles |first10=D |last11=Enkhbayar |first11=A |last12=Graziotin  |first12=D |last13=Harding  |first13=R |last14=Havemann |first14=J |last15=Katz |first15=D |last16=Khanal |first16=K |last17=Norgaard Kjaer |first17=J |last18=Koder |first18=T |last19=Macklin |first19=P |last20=Madan |first20=C |last21=Masuzzo |first21=P |last22=Matthias |first22=L |last23=Mayer |first23=K |last24=Nichols |first24=D |last25=Papadopoulou |first25=E |last26=Pasquier |first26=T |last27=Ross-Hellauer |first27=T |last28=Schulte-Mecklenbeck |first28=M |last29=Sholler |first29=D |last30=Steiner |first30=T |last31=Szczesny |first31=P |last32=Turner |first32=A |title=Foundations for Open Scholarship Strategy Development |url=https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/b4v8p/ |website=MetaArXiv |access-date=13 August 2020 |doi=10.31222/osf.io/b4v8p|s2cid=159417649 }}</ref>

Open science can be seen as a continuation of, rather than a revolution in, practices begun in the 17th century with the advent of the [[academic journal]], when the societal demand for access to scientific knowledge reached a point at which it became necessary for groups of scientists to share resources<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/15431919/ Machado, J. "Open data and open science". ''In'' Albagli, Maciel & Abdo. "Open Science, Open Questions", 2015]</ref> with each other.<ref name="emergence" /> In modern times there is debate about the extent to which scientific information should be shared.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=198-202}} The conflict that led to the Open Science movement is between the desire of scientists to have access to shared resources versus the desire of individual entities to profit when other entities partake of their resources.<ref name="pauladavid" /> Additionally, the status of [[open access]] and resources that are available for its promotion are likely to differ from one field of academic inquiry to another.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://openscience.com/ |title = Open Science &#124; A Guide to Open Access, Publishing Market and Recent Developments}}</ref>

== Background ==

Science is broadly understood as collecting, analyzing, publishing, reanalyzing, critiquing, and reusing data. Proponents of open science identify a number of barriers that impede or dissuade the broad dissemination of scientific data.<ref name="molloy">{{Cite journal|last1=Molloy|first1=J. C.|title=The Open Knowledge Foundation: Open Data Means Better Science|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=9|issue=12|pages=e1001195|year=2011|pmid=22162946|pmc=3232214|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195}}</ref>
These include financial [[paywall]]s of for-profit research publishers, restrictions on usage applied by publishers of data, poor formatting of data or use of proprietary software that makes it difficult to re-purpose, and cultural reluctance to publish data for fears of losing control of how the information is used.<ref name="molloy" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://im2punt0.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/defining-open-science-definitions/|title=Defining Open Science Definitions|last=Bosman|first=Jeroen|date=2 March 2017|website=I&M / I&O 2.0|access-date=27 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Types ===
The term "open science" does not have any one fixed definition or operationalization. On the one hand, it has been referred to as a "puzzling phenomenon".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=David|first=P.A.|year=2008|title=The historical origins of 'Open Science': An essay on patronage, reputation and common agency contracting in the scientific revolution|journal=Capitalism and Society |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=5|ssrn=2209188|doi=10.2202/1932-0213.1040|s2cid=41478207}}</ref> On the other hand, the term has been used to encapsulate a series of principles that aim to foster scientific growth and its complementary access to the public. Two influential sociologists, Benedikt Fecher and Sascha Friesike, have created multiple "schools of thought" that describe the different interpretations of the term.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fecher|first1=Benedikt|last2=Friesike|first2=Sascha|year=2014|title=Open Science: One Term, Five Schools of Thought|url=http://book.openingscience.org/basics_background/open_science_one_term_five_schools_of_thought.html|journal=Opening Science|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2|pages=17–47|isbn=978-3-319-00025-1}}</ref>

According to Fecher and Friesike ‘Open Science’ is an umbrella term for various assumptions about the development and dissemination of knowledge. To show the term's multitudinous perceptions, they differentiate between five Open Science schools of thought:

==== Infrastructure School ====

The infrastructure school is founded on the assumption that "efficient" research depends on the availability of tools and applications. Therefore, the "goal" of the school is to promote the creation of openly available platforms, tools, and services for scientists. Hence, the infrastructure school is concerned with the technical infrastructure that promotes the development of emerging and developing research practices through the use of the internet, including the use of software and applications, in addition to conventional computing networks. In that sense, the infrastructure school regards open science as a technological challenge.  The infrastructure school is tied closely with the notion of "cyberscience", which describes the trend of applying information and communication technologies to scientific research, which has led to an amicable development of the infrastructure school. Specific elements of this prosperity include increasing collaboration and interaction between scientists, as well as the development of "open-source science" practices. The sociologists discuss two central trends in the infrastructure school:

1. [[Distributed computing]]: This trend encapsulates practices that outsource complex, process-heavy scientific computing to a network of volunteer computers around the world.  The examples that the sociologists cite in their paper is that of the [[Open Science Grid]], which enables the development of large-scale projects that require high-volume data management and processing, which is accomplished through a distributed computer network. Moreover, the grid provides the necessary tools that the scientists can use to facilitate this process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Altunay|first1=M.|display-authors=etal |year=2010|title=A science-driven production Cyberinfrastructure—the Open Science grid|journal=Journal of Grid Computing|volume=9|issue=2|pages=201–218|doi=10.1007/s10723-010-9176-6 |s2cid=1636510}}</ref>

2. Social and Collaboration Networks of Scientists: This trend encapsulates the development of software that makes interaction with other researchers and scientific collaborations much easier than traditional, non-digital practices. Specifically, the trend is focused on implementing newer [[Web 2.0]] tools to facilitate research related activities on the internet. De Roure and colleagues (2008)<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1109/eScience.2008.86|chapter=My ''Experiment'': Defining the Social Virtual Research Environment|title=2008 IEEE Fourth International Conference on e ''Science''|pages=182–189|year=2008|last1=Roure|first1=David De|last2=Goble|first2=Carole|last3=Bhagat|first3=Jiten|last4=Cruickshank|first4=Don|last5=Goderis|first5=Antoon|last6=Michaelides|first6=Danius|last7=Newman|first7=David|isbn=978-1-4244-3380-3|s2cid=11104419|chapter-url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/266560/1/escimyexpv6.pdf}}</ref> list a series of four key capabilities which they believe define a Social Virtual Research Environment (SVRE):
* The SVRE should primarily aid the management and sharing of research objects. The authors define these to be a variety of digital commodities that are used repeatedly by researchers.
* Second, the SVRE should have inbuilt incentives for researchers to make their research objects available on the online platform.
* Third, the SVRE should be "open" as well as "extensible", implying that different types of digital artifacts composing the SVRE can be easily integrated.
* Fourth, the authors propose that the SVRE is more than a simple storage tool for research information.  Instead, the researchers propose that the platform should be "actionable". That is, the platform should be built in such a way that research objects can be used in the conduct of research as opposed to simply being stored.

==== Measurement school ====
{{See also|Scientometrics}}
The measurement school, in the view of the authors, deals with developing alternative methods to determine [[scientific impact]]. This school acknowledges that measurements of scientific impact are crucial to a researcher's reputation, [[science funding|funding]] opportunities, and career development. Hence, the authors argue, that any discourse about Open Science is pivoted around developing a robust measure of scientific impact in the digital age.  The authors then discuss other research indicating support for the measurement school. The three key currents of previous literature discussed by the authors are:

* The [[academic peer review|peer-review]] is described as being time-consuming.
* The impact of an article, tied to the name of the authors of the article, is related more to the circulation of the journal rather than the overall quality of the article itself.
* New publishing formats that are closely aligned with the philosophy of Open Science are rarely found in the format of a journal that allows for the assignment of the impact factor.

Hence, this school argues that there are faster impact measurement technologies that can account for a range of publication types as well as social media web coverage of a scientific contribution to arrive at a complete evaluation of how impactful the science contribution was. The gist of the argument for this school is that hidden uses like reading, bookmarking, sharing, discussing and rating are traceable activities, and these traces can and should be used to develop a newer measure of scientific impact. The umbrella jargon for this new type of impact measurements is called altmetrics, coined in a 2011 article by Priem et al., (2011).<ref>Priem, J., et al. (2011). Uncovering impacts: CitedIn and total-impact, two new tools for
gathering altmetrics (pp. 9–11). In iConference 2012. Available at: http://jasonpriem.org/selfarchived/two-altmetrics-tools.pdf</ref> Markedly, the authors discuss evidence that [[altmetrics]] differ from traditional [[webometrics]] which are slow and unstructured. Altmetrics are proposed to rely upon a greater set of measures that account for tweets, blogs, discussions, and bookmarks. The authors claim that the existing literature has often proposed that altmetrics should also encapsulate the scientific process, and measure the process of research and collaboration to create an overall metric. However, the authors are explicit in their assessment that few papers offer methodological details as to how to accomplish this. The authors use this and the general dearth of evidence to conclude that research in the area of altmetrics is still in its infancy.

==== Public School ====

According to the authors, the central concern of the school is to make science accessible to a wider audience. The inherent assumption of this school, as described by the authors, is that the newer communication technologies such as [[Web 2.0]] allow scientists to open up the research process and also allow scientist to better prepare their "products of research" for interested non-experts. Hence, the school is characterized by two broad streams: one argues for the access of the research process to the masses, whereas the other argues for increased access to the scientific product to the public.

* Accessibility to the Research Process:  Communication technology allows not only for the constant documentation of research but also promotes the inclusion of many different external individuals in the process itself.  The authors cite [[citizen science]]- the participation of non-scientists and amateurs in research. The authors discuss instances in which gaming tools allow scientists to harness the brain power of a volunteer workforce to run through several permutations of protein-folded structures. This allows for scientists to eliminate many more plausible protein structures while also "enriching" the citizens about science. The authors also discuss a common criticism of this approach: the amateur nature of the participants threatens to pervade the scientific rigor of experimentation.
* Comprehensibility of the Research Result: This stream of research concerns itself with making research understandable for a wider audience. The authors describe a host of authors that promote the use of specific tools for scientific communication, such as microblogging services, to direct users to relevant literature. The authors claim that this school proposes that it is the obligation of every researcher to make their research accessible to the public.  The authors then proceed to discuss if there is an emerging market for brokers and mediators of knowledge that is otherwise too complicated for the public to grasp.

==== Democratic school ====

The democratic school concerns itself with the concept of [[access to knowledge]]. As opposed to focusing on the accessibility of research and its understandability, advocates of this school focus on the access of products of research to the public. The central concern of the school is with the legal and other obstacles that hinder the access of research publications and scientific data to the public. Proponents assert that any research product should be freely available. and that everyone has the same, equal right of access to knowledge, especially in the instances of state-funded experiments and data.  Two central currents characterize this school: Open Access and Open Data.

* [[Open Data]]: Opposition to the notion that publishing journals should claim copyright over experimental data, which prevents the re-use of data and therefore lowers the overall efficiency of science in general. The claim is that journals have no use of the experimental data and that allowing other researchers to use this data will be fruitful. Only a quarter of researchers agree to share their data with other researchers because of the effort required for compliance.
* [[Open Access]] to Research Publication: According to this school, there is a gap between the creation and sharing of knowledge. Proponents argue that even though scientific knowledge doubles every 5 years, access to this knowledge remains limited. These proponents consider access to knowledge as a necessity for human development, especially in the economic sense.

==== Pragmatic School ====

The pragmatic school considers Open Science as the possibility to make knowledge creation and dissemination more efficient by increasing the collaboration throughout the research process. Proponents argue that science could be optimized by modularizing the process and opening up the scientific value chain. ‘Open’ in this sense follows very much the concept of [[open innovation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Friesike|first1=S.|display-authors=etal |year=2015|title=Opening science: towards an agenda of open science in academia and industry|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=40|issue=4|pages=581–601|doi=10.1007/s10961-014-9375-6 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Take for instance transfers the outside-in (including external knowledge in the production process) and inside-out (spillovers from the formerly closed production process) principles to science.<ref>Tacke, O., 2010. Open Science 2.0: How Research and Education Can Benefit from Open Innovation and Web 2.0. In T. J. Bastiaens, U. Baumöl, & B. J. Krämer, eds. On Collective Intelligence. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 37–48..</ref> [[Web 2.0]] is considered a set of helpful tools that can foster collaboration (sometimes also referred to as [[Science 2.0]]). Further, [[citizen science]] is seen as a form of collaboration that includes knowledge and information from non-scientists. Fecher and Friesike describe [[data sharing]] as an example of the pragmatic school as it enables researchers to use other researchers’ data to pursue new research questions or to conduct data-driven replications.

== History ==
The widespread adoption of the institution of the [[scientific journal]] marks the beginning of the modern concept of open science. Before this time societies pressured scientists into secretive behaviors.

=== Before journals ===
Before the advent of scientific journals, scientists had little to gain and much to lose by publicizing scientific discoveries.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Many scientists, including [[Galileo]], [[Kepler]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[Robert Hooke]], made claim to their discoveries by describing them in papers coded in anagrams or cyphers and then distributing the coded text.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Their intent was to develop their discovery into something off which they could profit, then reveal their discovery to prove ownership when they were prepared to make a claim on it.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}}

The system of not publicizing discoveries caused problems because discoveries were not shared quickly and because it sometimes was difficult for the discoverer to prove priority. Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] both claimed [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy|priority in discovering calculus]].{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Newton said that he wrote about [[calculus]] in the 1660s and 1670s, but did not publish until 1693.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Leibniz published "[[Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis]]", a treatise on calculus, in 1684. Debates over priority are inherent in systems where science is not published openly, and this was problematic for scientists who wanted to benefit from priority.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

These cases are representative of a system of aristocratic [[patronage]] in which scientists received funding to develop either immediately useful things or to entertain.<ref name="emergence">{{Cite journal|last1=David|first1=P. A.|title=Understanding the emergence of 'open science' institutions: Functionalist economics in historical context|doi=10.1093/icc/dth023|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|volume=13|issue=4|pages=571–589|year=2004}}</ref> In this sense, funding of science gave prestige to the patron in the same way that funding of artists, writers, architects, and philosophers did.<ref name="emergence" /> Because of this, scientists were under pressure to satisfy the desires of their patrons, and discouraged from being open with research which would bring prestige to persons other than their patrons.<ref name="emergence" />

=== Emergence of academies and journals ===
Eventually the individual patronage system ceased to provide the scientific output which society began to demand.<ref name="emergence" /> Single patrons could not sufficiently fund scientists, who had unstable careers and needed consistent funding.<ref name="emergence" /> The development which changed this was a trend to pool research by multiple scientists into an academy funded by multiple patrons.<ref name="emergence" /> In 1660 England established the [[Royal Society]] and in 1666 the French established the [[French Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="emergence" /> Between the 1660s and 1793, governments gave official recognition to 70 other scientific organizations modeled after those two academies.<ref name="emergence" /><ref>{{cite book|last=McClellan III|first=James E.|title=Science reorganized : scientific societies in the eighteenth century|year=1985|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-05996-1}}</ref> In 1665, [[Henry Oldenburg]] became the editor of [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]], the first [[academic journal]] devoted to science, and the foundation for the growth of scientific publishing.{{sfn|Groen|2007|p=215-216}} By 1699 there were 30 scientific journals; by 1790 there were 1052.{{sfn|Kronick|1976|p=78}} Since then publishing has expanded at even greater rates.{{sfn|Price|1986}}

=== Popular Science Writing ===
The first popular science periodical of its kind was published in 1872, under a suggestive name that is still a modern portal for the offering science journalism: Popular Science. The magazine claims to have documented the invention of the telephone, the phonograph, the electric light and the onset of automobile technology.  The magazine goes so far as to claim that the "history of Popular Science is a true reflection of humankind's progress over the past 129+ years".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-07/history-popular-science|title=The History of Popular Science|website=Popular Science|date=18 March 2019}}</ref> Discussions of popular science writing most often contend their arguments around some type of "Science Boom". A recent historiographic account of popular science traces mentions of the term "science boom" to Daniel Greenberg's Science and Government Reports in 1979 which posited that "Scientific magazines are bursting out all over. Similarly, this account discusses the publication Time, and its cover story of Carl Sagan in 1980 as propagating the claim that popular science has "turned into enthusiasm".<ref>Lewenstein, Bruce V. "Was there really a popular science "boom"?." Science, Technology, & Human Values 12.2 (1987): 29–41.</ref> Crucially, this secondary accounts asks the important question as to what was considered as popular "science" to begin with. The paper claims that any account of how popular science writing bridged the gap between the informed masses and the expert scientists must first consider who was considered a scientist to begin with.

=== Collaboration among academies ===
In modern times many academies have pressured researchers at publicly funded universities and research institutions to engage in a mix of sharing research and making some technological developments proprietary.<ref name="pauladavid">{{cite journal|last=David|first=Paul A.|title=Can "Open Science" be Protected from the Evolving Regime of IPR Protections?|journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics|date=March 2004|volume=160|issue=1|pages=9–34|jstor=40752435|doi=10.1628/093245604773861069}}</ref> Some research products have the potential to generate commercial revenue, and in hope of capitalizing on these products, many research institutions withhold information and technology which otherwise would lead to overall scientific advancement if other research institutions had access to these resources.<ref name="pauladavid" /> It is difficult to predict the potential payouts of technology or to assess the costs of withholding it, but there is general agreement that the benefit to any single institution of holding technology is not as great as the cost of withholding it from all other research institutions.<ref name="pauladavid" />

=== Coining of phrase "Open Science" ===
Although [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] claims to have coined the phrase "Open Science" in 1998, at which time he also registered the domain name openscience.com and openscience.org which he sold to degruyter.com in 2011, it was actually first used in a manner that refers to today's 'open science' norms by [https://www.aip.org/aip/assembly/daryl-chubin Daryl E. Chubin] in his essay "Open Science and Closed Science: Tradeoffs in a Democracy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://who.is/domain-history/openscience.com|title=openscience.com historical whois information – who.is|website=who.is}}</ref><ref>Surveillance (oversight), Sousveillance (undersight), and Metaveillance (seeing sight itself), CVPR 2016, pages 1408–1417</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chubin|first=Daryl E.|date=1985-04-01|title=Open Science and Closed Science: Tradeoffs in a Democracy|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/016224398501000211|journal=Science, Technology, & Human Values|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=73–80|doi=10.1177/016224398501000211|s2cid=145631585|issn=0162-2439}}</ref> Chubin's essay was basically a revisiting of [[Robert K. Merton]]'s 1942 proposal of what we now refer to as [[Mertonian norms|Mertonian Norms]] for ideal science practices and scientific modes of communication.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=1942|title=Science and technology in a democratic order|journal=Journal of Legal and Political Sociology|volume=1|pages=115–126}}</ref> The term was used sporadically in the 1970s and 1980s in various scholarship to refer to different things, but clearly the Steve Mann does not deserve credit for inventing this term or the movement leading to its adoption.

=== Internet and the free access to scientific documents ===
The open science movement, as presented in activist and institutional discourses at the beginning of the 21st century, refers to different ways of opening up science, especially in the [[Internet]] age. Its first pillar is [[Open access|free access to scientific publications]]. The Budapest conference organised by the Open Society Foundations in 2001 was decisive in imposing this issue on the political landscape. The resulting declaration calls for the use of digital tools such as open archives and open access journals, free of charge for the reader.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Budapest Open Access Initiative {{!}} Read the Budapest Open Access Initiative|url=https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org}}</ref>

The idea of open access to scientific publications quickly became inseparable from the question of free licenses to guarantee the right to disseminate and possibly modify shared documents, such as the [[Creative Commons]] licenses, created in 2002. In 2011, a new text from the Budapest Open Initiative explicitly refers to the relevance of the CC-BY license to guarantee free dissemination and not only free access to a scientific document.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Budapest Open Access Initiative {{!}} Ten years on from the Budapest Open Access Initiative: setting the default to open|url=https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/boai-10-recommendations|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org}}</ref>

The openness promise by the Internet is then extended to research data, which underpins scientific studies in different disciplines, as mentioned already in the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities|Berlin Declaration]] in 2003. In 2007, the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) published a report on access to publicly funded research data, in which it defined it as the data that validates research results.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=OECD|date=2007|title=OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding|url=https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/38500813.pdf|journal=OECD|series=OECD Journal on Development|doi=10.1787/journal_dev-v8-2-en|isbn=9789264019652}}</ref>

Beyond its democratic virtues, open science aims to respond to the replication crisis of research results, notably through the generalization of the opening of data or [[source code]] used to produce them or through the dissemination of methodological articles.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Union|first=Publications Office of the European|date=2020-12-01|title=Reproducibility of scientific results in the EU : scoping report.|url=http://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/6bc538ad-344f-11eb-b27b-01aa75ed71a1|access-date=2021-06-07|website=op.europa.eu|isbn=9789276198888|language=en}}</ref>

The open science movement inspired several regulatory and legislative measures. Thus, in 2007, the [[University of Liège]] made the deposit of its researchers’ publications in its institutional open repository (Orbi) compulsory. The next year, the [[NIH Public Access Policy]] adopted a similar mandate for every paper funded by the National Institutes of Health. In France, [[Loi pour une République numérique|the law for a digital Republic]] enacted in 2016 creates the right to deposit the validated manuscript of a scientific article in an open archive, with an embargo period following the date of publication in the journal. The law also creates the principle of reuse of public data by default.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/dossierlegislatif/JORFDOLE000031589829/|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr}}</ref>

== Politics ==
In many countries, governments fund some science research. Scientists often publish the results of their research by writing articles and donating them to be published in scholarly journals, which frequently are commercial. Public entities such as universities and libraries subscribe to these journals. [[Michael Eisen]], a founder of the [[Public Library of Science]], has described this system by saying that "taxpayers who already paid for the research would have to pay again to read the results."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/opinion/research-bought-then-paid-for.html|title=Research Bought, Then Paid For|first=Michael|last=Eisen|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 January 2012|location=New York City|issn=0362-4331|access-date=12 February 2012}}</ref>

In December 2011, some United States legislators introduced a bill called the [[Research Works Act]], which would prohibit federal agencies from issuing grants with any provision requiring that articles reporting on taxpayer-funded research be published for free to the public online.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Hot-Type-Who-Gets-to-See/130403/|title=Who Gets to See Published Research? |first=Jennifer|last=Howard|journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=22 January 2012|access-date=12 February 2012}}</ref> Darrell Issa, a co-sponsor of the bill, explained the bill by saying that "Publicly funded research is and must continue to be absolutely available to the public. We must also protect the value added to publicly funded research by the private sector and ensure that there is still an active commercial and non-profit research community."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-is-open-internet-champion-darrell-issa-supporting-an-attack-on-open-science/250929/|title=Why Is Open-Internet Champion Darrell Issa Supporting an Attack on Open Science? – Rebecca J. Rosen|first=Rebecca J.|last=Rosen|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=5 January 2012|access-date=12 February 2012}}</ref> One response to this bill was protests from various researchers; among them was a boycott of commercial publisher [[Elsevier]] called [[The Cost of Knowledge]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/testify-the-open-science-movement-catches-fire/|title=Testify: The Open-Science Movement Catches Fire|first=David|last=Dobbs|magazine=Wired|date=30 January 2012|access-date=12 February 2012}}</ref>

The Dutch [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] called out for action in April 2016 to migrate European Commission funded research to Open Science. European Commissioner [[Carlos Moedas]] introduced the Open Science Cloud at the Open Science Conference in Amsterdam on 4–5 April.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/media/eu-wil-dat-onderzoekers-gegevens-meer-gaan-delen-in-eigen-datacloud~a4276263/|title=EU wil dat onderzoekers gegevens meer gaan delen in eigen datacloud|first=Martijn|last=Van Calmthout|date=5 April 2016|access-date=8 April 2016|newspaper=De Volkskrant}}</ref> During this meeting also [[The Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science]] was presented, a living document outlining concrete actions for the European Community to move to Open Science. The European Commission continues to be committed to an Open Science policy including developing a repository for research digital objects, [[European Open Science Cloud]] (EOSC) and metrics for evaluating quality and impact.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Open Science|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/goals-research-and-innovation-policy/open-science_en|access-date=2021-04-18|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en}}</ref>

In October{{nbsp}}2021, the [[Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation (France)|French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation]] released an official translation of its second plan for open science spanning the years 2021–2024.<ref name="french-government-2021">

=== Standard setting instruments ===

There is currently no global normative framework covering all aspects of Open Science. In November 2019, [[UNESCO]] was tasked by its 193 Member States, during their 40th General Conference, with leading a global dialogue on Open Science to identify globally-agreed norms and to create a standard-setting instrument.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-takes-lead-developing-new-global-standard-setting-instrument-open-science|title=Press release: UNESCO Takes the Lead in Developing a New Global Standard-setting Instrument on Open Science|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=28 November 2019|access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://en.unesco.org/generalconference/40/results|title=Press release: Outcomes of the 40th General Conference|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=27 November 2019|access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref> The multistakeholder, consultative, inclusive and participatory process to define a new global normative instrument on Open Science is expected to take two years and to lead to the adoption of a UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science by Member States in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000370291.locale=en|title=Resolution 40 C/63 on the desirability of a recommendation on Open Science|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref>

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Arguments in favor of open science generally focus on the value of increased transparency in research, and in the public ownership of science, particularly that which is publicly funded. In January 2014 J. Christopher Bare published a comprehensive "Guide to Open Science".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://digitheadslabnotebook.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/guide-to-open-science.html |title = Guide to Open Science|date = 9 January 2014}}</ref> Likewise, in 2017, a group of scholars known for advocating open science published a "manifesto" for open science in the journal ''Nature.''<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Munafò|first1=Marcus R.|last2=Nosek|first2=Brian A.|last3=Bishop|first3=Dorothy V.

=== Advantages ===
;Open access publication of research reports and data allows for rigorous peer-review
An article published by a team of NASA astrobiologists in 2010 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reported a [[bactera|bacterium]] known as [[GFAJ-1]] that could purportedly metabolize arsenic (unlike any previously known species of lifeform).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolfe-Simon|first1=Felisa|author-link=Felisa Wolfe-Simon|last2=Blum|first2=Jodi Switzer|last3=Kulp|first3=Thomas R.|last4=Gordon|first4=Gwyneth W.|last5=Hoeft|first5=Shelley E.|last6=Pett-Ridge|first6=Jennifer|last7=Stolz|first7=John F.|last8=Webb|first8=Samuel M.|last9=Weber|first9=Peter K.|last10=Davies|first10=P.

'''Publicly funded science will be publicly available'''

In 2009 NASA launched the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] spacecraft and promised that they would release collected data in June 2010. Later they decided to postpone release so that their scientists could look at it first. Their rationale was that non-scientists might unintentionally misinterpret the data, and NASA scientists thought it would be preferable for them to be familiar with the data in advance so that they could report on it with their level of accuracy.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=201}}

;Low-quality science

Post-publication peer review, a staple of open science, has been criticized as promoting the production of lower quality papers that are extremely voluminous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ronininstitute.org/open-science-and-its-discontents/1383/|title=Open Science and its Discontents – Ronin Institute|website=ronininstitute.org}}</ref> Specifically, critics assert that as quality is not guaranteed by preprint servers, the veracity of papers will be difficult to assess by individual readers. This will lead to rippling effects of false science, akin to the recent epidemic of false news, propagated with ease on social media websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/tags/502124007/fake-news|title=Fake news|website=[[NPR]]}}</ref> Common solutions to this problem have been cited as adaptations of a new format in which everything is allowed to be published but a subsequent filter-curator model is imposed to ensure some basic quality of standards are met by all publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewinnower.com/|title=The Winnower – Open Scholarly Publishing|website=thewinnower.com}}</ref>

; Entrapment by platform capitalism

For [[Philip Mirowski]] open science runs the risk of continuing a trend of commodification of science<ref name='Science mart'>P. Mirowski, ''Science''-Mart, Privatizing American Science. Harvard University Press, 2011.</ref> which ultimately serves the interests of capital in the guise of [[platform capitalism]].<ref name='Platform'>P. Mirowski, "The future(s) of open science," Soc. Stud. Sci., vol. 48, no. 2, pp. 171–203, Apr. 2018.</ref>

== Actions and initiatives ==

=== Open-science projects ===

Different projects conduct, advocate, develop tools for, or fund open science.

The [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Paul|title=Why We Chose 'Open Science'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204630904577058162033028028|access-date=6 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=30 November 2011}}</ref> conducts numerous open science projects while the [[Center for Open Science]] has projects to conduct, advocate, and create tools for open science. Other workgroups have been created in different fields, such as the Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darthworkgroup.com/|title=DARTH – Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health}}</ref> which is a multi-institutional, multi-university collaborative effort by researchers who have a common goal to develop transparent and open-source solutions to decision analysis in health.

Organizations have extremely diverse sizes and structures. The [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] (OKF) is a global organization sharing large data catalogs, running face to face conferences, and supporting open source software projects. In contrast, [[Blue Obelisk]] is an informal group of chemists and associated [[cheminformatics]] projects. The tableau of organizations is dynamic with some organizations becoming defunct, e.g., [[Science Commons]], and new organizations trying to grow, e.g., the Self-Journal of Science.<ref>http://www.sjscience.org</ref>  Common organizing forces include the knowledge domain, type of service provided, and even geography, e.g., [[OCSDNet]]'s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocsdnet.org|title=OCSDNET|website=OCSDNET}}</ref> concentration on the developing world.

The [[Allen Brain Atlas]] maps gene expression in human and mouse brains; [[the Encyclopedia of Life]] documents all the terrestrial species; the [[Galaxy Zoo]] classifies galaxies; the [[International HapMap Project]] maps the [[haplotype]]s of the human genome; [[the Monarch Initiative]] makes available integrated public model organism and clinical data; and the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] which regularizes and publishes data sets from many sources. All these projects accrete information provided by many different researchers with different standards of curation and contribution.

Mathematician [[Timothy Gowers]] launched open science journal [[Discrete Analysis]] in 2016 to demonstrate that a high-quality mathematics journal could be produced outside the traditional [[academic publishing]] industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gowers.wordpress.com/2016/03/01/discrete-analysis-launched/|title=Discrete Analysis launched|date=1 March 2016|website=Gowers's Weblog|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> The launch followed a boycott of scientific journals that he initiated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://discreteanalysisjournal.com/|title=Discrete Analysis|website=discreteanalysisjournal.com|language=en|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> The journal is published by a nonprofit which is owned and published by a team of scholars.

Other projects are organized around completion of projects that require extensive collaboration.  For example, [[OpenWorm]] seeks to make a cellular level simulation of a roundworm, a multidisciplinary project. The [[Polymath Project]] seeks to solve difficult mathematical problems by enabling faster communications within the discipline of mathematics. The Collaborative Replications and Education project recruits undergraduate students as [[Citizen Science|citizen scientists]] by offering funding. Each project defines its needs for contributors and collaboration.

Another practical example for open science project was the first "open" doctoral thesis started in 2012. It was made publicly available as a self-experiment right from the start to examine whether this dissemination is even possible during the productive stage of scientific studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.helmholtz.de/en/science_and_society/a-discussion-about-transparency/|title=A discussion about transparency|website=helmholtz.de|publisher=[[Helmholtz Association]]|language=en|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Heise|first1=Christian|last2=Pearce|first2=Joshua M.|date=10 May 2020|title=From Open Access to Open Science: The Path From Scientific Reality to Open Scientific Communication|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|doi=10.1177/2158244020915900|issn=2158-2440|doi-access=free}}</ref> The goal of the dissertation project: Publish everything related to the doctoral study and research process as soon as possible, as comprehensive as possible and under an open license, online available at all time for everyone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://offene-doktorarbeit.de/about-english/|title=About the first open PhD thesis|website=offene-doktorarbeit.de|language=en|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref> End of 2017, the experiment was successfully completed and published in early 2018 as an open access book.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heise|first=Christian|date=15 January 2018|title=Von Open Access zu Open Science|url=https://meson.press/books/von-open-access-zu-open-science/|location=Lüneburg, Germany|publisher=meson press e.G.|language=de|isbn=978-3-95796-130-3|doi=10.14619/1303 }}</ref>

The ideas of open science have also been applied to recruitment with jobRxiv, a free and international job board that aims to mitigate imbalances in what different labs can afford to spend on hiring.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Browse Jobs|url=https://jobrxiv.org/|access-date=26 June 2020|website=jobRxiv|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|number=1276247608072306693|user=jobRxiv|title=We want to change the way recruitment for #ScienceJobs is done, to open up a way for all labs to find the best cand…<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.

=== Advocacy ===
Numerous documents, organizations, and social movements advocate wider adoption of open science.  Statements of principles include the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] from a December 2001 conference<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1818652.stm|title=Boost for research paper access|first=Ivan|last=Noble|work=[[BBC News]]|date=14 February 2002|location=London|access-date=12 February 2012}}</ref> and the [[Panton Principles]]. New statements are constantly developed, such as the [[Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science]] to be presented to the Dutch [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] in late May 2016.  These statements often try to regularize licenses and disclosure for data and scientific literature.

Other advocates concentrate on educating scientists about appropriate open science software tools.  Education is available as training seminars, e.g., the [[Software Carpentry]] project; as domain specific training materials, e.g., the [[Data Carpentry]] project; and as materials for teaching graduate classes, e.g., the Open Science Training Initiative.  Many organizations also provide education in the general principles of open science.

Within scholarly societies there are also sections and interest groups that promote open science practices. The [[Ecological Society of America]] has an Open Science Section. Similarly, the [[Society for American Archaeology]] has an Open Science Interest Group.<ref name="marwick" />

=== Journal support ===
[[List of open access journals|Many individual journals]] are experimenting with [[open access journal|the open access model]]: the [[Public Library of Science]], or PLOS, is creating a library of open access journals and scientific literature. Other publishing experiments include [[delayed open access journal|delayed]] and [[hybrid open access journals|hybrid]] models. There are experiments in different fields:

* [[Faculty of 1000#F1000Research|F1000Research]] provides open publishing and open peer review for the life sciences.
* The open-science initiative of the [[Empirical Software Engineering Journal]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Méndez Fernández|first1=Daniel|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Feldt|first3=Robert|last4=Zimmermann|first4=Thomas|year=2019|title=The open science initiative of the Empirical Software Engineering journal|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=1057–1060|doi=10.1007/s10664-019-09712-x|issn=1382-3256|doi-access=free}}</ref> encourages authors to submit a replication package which is assessed with an open science badge.
* The [[Open Library of Humanities]] is a non-profit open access publisher for the humanities and social sciences.

Journal support for open-science does not contradict with [[preprint]] servers:
[[figshare]] archives and shares images, readings, and other data; and Open Science Framework preprints, [[arXiv]], and [[Hyper Articles en Ligne|HAL Archives Ouvertes]] provide electronic preprints across many fields.

=== Software ===
A variety of computer resources support open science. These include software like the [[Open Science Framework]] from the [[Center for Open Science]] to manage project information, data archiving and team coordination; distributed computing services like [[Ibercivis]] to use unused CPU time for computationally intensive tasks; and services like [[Experiment (website)|Experiment.com]] to provide crowdsourced funding for research projects.

[[Blockchain]] platforms for open science have been proposed. The first such platform is the Open Science Organization, which aims to solve urgent problems with fragmentation of the scientific ecosystem and difficulties of producing validated, quality science. Among the initiatives of Open Science Organization include the Interplanetary Idea System (IPIS), Researcher Index (RR-index), Unique Researcher Identity (URI), and Research Network. The Interplanetary Idea System is a blockchain based system that tracks the evolution of scientific ideas over time. It serves to quantify ideas based on uniqueness and importance, thus allowing the scientific community to identify pain points with current scientific topics and preventing unnecessary re-invention of previously conducted science. The Researcher Index aims to establish a data-driven statistical metric for quantifying researcher impact. The Unique Researcher Identity is a blockchain technology based solution for creating a single unifying identity for each researcher, which is connected to the researcher's profile, research activities, and publications. The Research Network is a social networking platform for researchers.

A scientific paper from November 2019 examined the suitability of blockchain technology to support open science.<ref name="leible2019">{{Cite journal|last1=Leible|first1=Stephan|last2=Schlager|first2=Steffen|last3=Schubotz|first3=Moritz|last4=Gipp|first4=Bela|year=2019|title=A Review on Blockchain Technology and Blockchain Projects Fostering Open Science|journal=Frontiers in Blockchain|language=en|volume=2|pages=1–28|doi=10.3389/fbloc.2019.00016|doi-access=free}}</ref> The results of their research showed that the technology is well suited for open science and can provide advantages, for example, in data security, trust, and collaboration. However, they state that the widespread use of the technology depends on whether the scientific community accepts it and adapts its processes accordingly.

=== Preprint servers ===
{{Main|Preprint}}
Preprint Servers come in many varieties, but the standard traits across them are stable: they seek to create a quick, free mode of communicating scientific knowledge to the public. Preprint servers act as a venue to quickly disseminate research and vary on their policies concerning when articles may be submitted relative to journal acceptance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/about-biorxiv|title=Advancing the sharing of research results for the life sciences|website=biorxiv.org|language=en|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxivinfo.org/training|title=Copyright Training Resources {{!}} MarXiv|website=www.marxivinfo.org|language=en|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> Also typical of preprint servers is their lack of a peer-review process – typically, preprint servers have some type of quality check in place to ensure a minimum standard of publication, but this mechanism is not the same as a peer-review mechanism. Some preprint servers have explicitly partnered with the broader open science movement.<ref name="socopen.org">{{cite web|url=https://socopen.org/2016/07/09/announcing-the-development-of-socarxiv-an-open-social-science-archive/|title=Announcing the development of SocArXiv, an open social science archive|date=9 July 2016}}</ref> Preprint servers can offer service similar to those of journals,<ref>Tierney, H. L., Hammond, P., Nordlander, P., & Weiss, P. S. (2012). Prior Publication: Extended Abstracts, Proceedings Articles, Preprint Servers, and the Like.</ref> and Google Scholar indexes many preprint servers and collects information about citations to preprints.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/accelerating-your-science-with-arxiv-and-google-scholar/|title=Accelerating Your Science with arXiv and Google Scholar|date=2 November 2012|work=An Assembly of Fragments|access-date=17 February 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The case for preprint servers is often made based on the slow pace of conventional publication formats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moed|first1=H. F.|year=2007|title=The effect of "open access" on citation impact: An analysis of ArXiv's Condensed matter section|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|volume=58|issue=13|pages=2047–2054|doi=10.1002/asi.20663|arxiv=cs/0611060|bibcode=2007JASIS..58.2047M|s2cid=1060908}}</ref> The motivation to start Socarxiv, an open-access preprint server for social science research, is the claim that valuable research being published in traditional venues often takes several months to years to get published, which slows down the process of science significantly. Another argument made in favor of preprint servers like Socarxiv is the quality and quickness of feedback offered to scientists on their pre-published work.<ref>Binfield, P. (2014). Novel scholarly journal concepts. In Opening science (pp. 155–163). Springer International Publishing.</ref> The founders of Socarxiv claim that their platform allows researchers to gain easy feedback from their colleagues on the platform, thereby allowing scientists to develop their work into the highest possible quality before formal publication and circulation. The founders of Socarxiv further claim that their platform affords the authors the greatest level of flexibility in updating and editing their work to ensure that the latest version is available for rapid dissemination. The founders claim that this is not traditionally the case with formal journals, which instate formal procedures to make updates to published articles{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Perhaps the strongest advantage of some preprint servers is their seamless compatibility with Open Science software such as the Open Science Framework. The founders of SocArXiv claim that their preprint server connects all aspects of the research life cycle in OSF with the article being published on the preprint server. According to the founders, this allows for greater transparency and minimal work on the authors' part.<ref name="socopen.org" />

One criticism of pre-print servers is their potential to foster a culture of plagiarism. For example, the popular physics preprint server ArXiv had to withdraw 22 papers when it came to light that they were plagiarized. In June 2002, a high-energy physicist in Japan was contacted by a man called Ramy Naboulsi, a non-institutionally affiliated mathematical physicist. Naboulsi requested Watanabe to upload his papers on ArXiv as he was not able to do so, because of his lack of an institutional affiliation. Later, the papers were realized to have been copied from the proceedings of a physics conference.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/426007a| pmid=14603280| title=Preprint server seeks way to halt plagiarists| journal=Nature| volume=426| issue=6962| pages=7| year=2003| last1=Giles| first1=Jim| bibcode=2003Natur.426Q...7G| doi-access=free}}</ref> Preprint servers are increasingly developing measures to circumvent this plagiarism problem. In developing nations like India and China, explicit measures are being taken to combat it.<ref>Chaddah, P. (2016). On the need for a National Preprint Repository. Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy, 82(4), 1167–1170.</ref> These measures usually involve creating some type of central repository for all available pre-prints, allowing the use of traditional plagiarism detecting algorithms to detect the fraud {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Nonetheless, this is a pressing issue in the discussion of pre-print servers, and consequently for open science.
